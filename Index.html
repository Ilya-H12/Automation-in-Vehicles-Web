              This website was created for the BUS 237 Group Assignment on emerging technologies. Our goal
              was to take a complex topic – automation in vehicles – and present it as a concise two-page
              report with a visual, interactive web version.
            </p>
            <p>
              The content below is the full report, including our discussion of regulations, cost of

              1 · An overview of vehicular automation
            </h3>
            <p>
              Artificial intelligence and a collection of sensing instruments that interface with the
              vehicle's software are at the core of vehicular automation. These systems allow the car to
              observe its surroundings, recognize objects and lane markings, and assist with driving tasks
              such as steering, braking, and accelerating. Together, they enable assisted driving that
              advances driving toward greater degrees of autonomy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tesla, BYD, and Hyundai are some of the many companies currently involved in this market, and
              they all take slightly different approaches. Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems
              focus heavily on gathering actual driving data from its fleet (Tesla, 2025).
            </p>
            <p>
              BYD is aiming to increase the number of automated features in its range of electric vehicles,
              particularly in China’s highly competitive EV market. Hyundai is integrating automation with
              connected-car platforms to reliably identify hazards and traffic changes (Hyundai, 2025).
            </p>
            <p>
              The technology is developed using the same process, despite the companies’ different
              approaches. The car observes the environment through cameras and other sensors, predicts how
              the scene will evolve over the next few seconds, and issues commands to keep the vehicle in
              lane, regulate throttle behavior, and react based on location data.

            <h3 class="section-title" style="font-size:1.2rem;">
              2 · Barriers to adoption and important regulations
            </h3>
            <p>
              Current Canadian federal and provincial legislation prevents the present adoption of
              completely autonomous motor vehicles on public roads. Canada does not yet have a unified
              safety framework that covers both physical and privacy concerns for fully autonomous systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The provincial regulations in British Columbia are governed by the Motor Vehicle Act, a
              legislation which covers traditional vehicles and drivers. Pilot-project provisions exist at a
              high level, but they mainly apply to carefully controlled trials, which limits the scale of
              experimentation to pilot projects exclusively hosted by the provincial government.
            </p>
            <p>
              The traditional regulation from archaic laws places the responsibility on the driver, even
              when automation is active. This mismatch between software-driven systems and human-centric
              laws creates uncertainty about liability and discourages automobile manufacturers from
              pursuing this innovation within Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, automated vehicles are digitally integrated, highlighting cybersecurity concerns.
              A malicious actor could exploit vulnerabilities to interfere with sensor inputs, manipulate
              the system’s interpretation of road conditions, or cause system crashes at high speeds.

              3 · Cost of manufacturing automation
            </h3>

            <h4>Key drivers of high cost today (2025)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Automation depends on LiDAR, Radar, multicamera systems, AI chips, and continuous software/cloud support.</li>
              <li>Specialized components and low production volume keep costs high.</li>
              <li>Validation and training of autonomous systems add major overhead.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top:1rem;">Current cost impact (2025)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Adds approximately <strong>$4k–$7k</strong> to manufacturing cost per vehicle.</li>
              <li>Translates to roughly <strong>$10k–$18k</strong> in additional retail price for consumers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top:1rem;">Cost decline drivers</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Economies of scale as adoption rises.</li>
              <li>Standardized sensor suites.</li>
              <li>More efficient, lower-cost AI chips.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top:1rem;">Long-term outlook</h4>
            <p>
              As these drivers play out, automation becomes mainstream and significantly cheaper by
              approximately 2035–2045. Over time, automated-driving features are expected to shift from a
              premium option to a standard technology package on many vehicles.

              4 · How humans interact with vehicular automation
            </h3>
            <p>
              Human behavior is one of the most important factors in how automation performs in the real
              world.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Lack of trust:</strong> Some users feel unsafe letting the car drive itself and under-use the technology.</li>
              <li><strong>Over-trust:</strong> Others pay too little attention and rely fully on the system, even when it is not designed for that level of autonomy.</li>
              <li><strong>Notification:</strong> Interfaces need clear alerts, feedback and handover signals so drivers understand when they must retake control.</li>
              <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> Education and experience will shape public acceptance over time.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

              5 · Human / vehicle communication
            </h3>

            <h4>Inside the vehicle</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Dash visualizations and heads-up displays (HUDs).</li>
              <li>Haptics such as steering-wheel vibration and lane-change assist.</li>
              <li>Voice cues and on-screen prompts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top:1rem;">Outside the vehicle</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Signals that show intent (yielding, proceeding, stopping).</li>
              <li>Predictable, consistent movement from the vehicle.</li>
              <li>Helping pedestrians and cyclists understand how the automated vehicle will behave.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top:1rem;">
              All of these factors help us understand how the integration of more advanced automation
              systems in everyday vehicles will change driving. They will also define how humans and
              vehicles continually learn and adapt to these new methods of transportation.
